INDEX explained:
width = 10
[1, width+1, width*2+1, 2]

after factoring in width:
=[01, 11, 21, 02]

taking those numbers as x and y values:
=[(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (0, 2)
]

the x and y values indicate which box to colour.

hope this helps.
[0,0]  [0,1]  [0,2]
[1,0]  [1,1]  [1,2]
[2,0]  [2,1]  [2,2]
